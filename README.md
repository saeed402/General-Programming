## ASCII Explanation

ASCII stands for "American Standard Code for Information Interchange." It's a character encoding standard used in computers and communication equipment to represent text and control characters. ASCII assigns a unique numerical value to each character, which allows computers to store, transmit, and process textual information.

In ASCII, each character is represented by a 7-bit binary number, resulting in a total of 128 possible characters. These characters include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, punctuation marks, special symbols, and control characters.

For example, here are a few ASCII characters along with their corresponding decimal and binary representations:

- Character: A
  - Decimal: 65
  - Binary: 01000001

- Character: 0
  - Decimal: 48
  - Binary: 00110000

- Character: !
  - Decimal: 33
  - Binary: 00100001

Control characters, like newline (NL), carriage return (CR), tab (TAB), and others, are also part of ASCII. These characters are used to control the formatting and behavior of text, especially in contexts such as printing and data communication.

ASCII was widely used in the early days of computing, particularly for English-language text. However, as computing became more global and diverse languages needed representation, the limitations of ASCII became apparent. This led to the development of Unicode, which supports a broader range of characters from various languages and scripts.

In summary, ASCII is a character encoding standard that provides a way to represent text and control characters using 7-bit binary numbers, making it a fundamental building block of computer-based communication and data storage.
